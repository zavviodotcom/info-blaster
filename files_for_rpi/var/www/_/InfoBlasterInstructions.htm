  <h1>Info-Blaster Instructions</h1>
  <p>With info-blaster powered and running, connect to wireless network named "Info-Blaster:http://10.0.0.1", to view content or administer system</p>
  <p>(The name of the wireless network can be changed using administration as described below)</p>
  <p>After connecting to wireless network, open browser to http://10.0.0.1 to view content</p>
  <p>To administer system, open browser to http://10.0.0.1:81/admin</p>
  <p>After initial install, user and password for administration are both set to <i>info-blaster</i>. Highly recommended to change before publishing content.</p>
  <p>To publish website, create website and compress files into zip file. Top-level should include index.html, index.htm, or index.php</p>
  <p>To publish file(s) instead of website, create zip file that does not include index.html, index.htm, or index.php</p>
  <p>After creating zip file, connect to administration and upload the file</p>
  <p>Factory reset notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>   Password hint can be read by opening browser to http://10.0.0.1:81/pwhint.</li>
  <li>   If password is forgotten the only way to recover is to perform factory reset. If factory reset is performed, all data including password, uploaded web content, activation, etc. are lost.</li>
  <li>   Prior to performing factory reset, the activation code should be read and recorded, by opening browser to http://10.0.0.1:81/activationStatus. The activation code will be needed later in the recovery process.</li> 
  <ul>
  <li>   Factory reset method: connect monitor and keyboard, reboot or power cycle, press 'shift' while booting to enter recovery mode, 'i' to install, 'enter' to confirm, then 'enter' to proceed after files are installed.</li>
  </ul>
